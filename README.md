Introduction

A Library Management System (LMS) is essential for efficiently managing library operations, keeping track of books, members, and transactions. This project outlines the creation of a database named "library," encompassing various tables that store relevant information about branches, employees, books, customers, and their interactions. By implementing an LMS, libraries can enhance their operational efficiency, streamline book management, and improve customer service.
